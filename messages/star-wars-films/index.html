      <p>I&rsquo;ve started to watch Star Wars films from the beginning. I initially was
afraid that it would be hard to bear because older movies are very slow, but it
turned out to be the other way around. I was hooked on the story after the
first 15 minutes and couldn&rsquo;t help but finished the whole Episode IV in one
run. It&rsquo;s not like other recent films which I need to break one up to smaller
pieces to consume. This is very interesting! Onto the Episode V now!</p>
