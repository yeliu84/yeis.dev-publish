Initially I was nervous, didn&rsquo;t know what it would do to the codebase. I therefore crafted the prompts very cautiously and reviewed the code changes very carefully. It was exhausting!
Claude didn&rsquo;t get it for the first try, we iterated a few times and we got the final working solution by the end of the day. I don&rsquo;t think I would be able to do this task this efficiently on my own since the codebase is brand new to me. I would estimate it as 2 days of work.">

<p>Today&rsquo;s experience was eye-opening, and I definitely will integrate Claude Code into my workflow.</p>
