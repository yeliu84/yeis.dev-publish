            <article><p>I&rsquo;ve been working in Seeq for 3 months now, the journey has been pretty smooth so far.</p>
<p>I have jumped into backend with Kotlin/Java very succesfully. That&rsquo;s what I hadn&rsquo;t done when working in startups, where there should have more opportunities for me to do so, I therefore feel it&rsquo;s quite ironic.</p>
<p>I would say I&rsquo;ve done a good job in these 3 months, and I&rsquo;ll continue to level myself up to do better.</p>

            <article><p>I&rsquo;ve worked with Claude Code the whole day today.</p>
<p>Initially I was nervous, didn&rsquo;t know what it would do to the codebase. I therefore crafted the prompts very cautiously and reviewed the code changes very carefully. It was exhausting!</p>
<p>Claude didn&rsquo;t get it for the first try, we iterated a few times and we got the final working solution by the end of the day. I don&rsquo;t think I would be able to do this task this efficiently on my own since the codebase is brand new to me. I would estimate it as 2 days of work.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s experience was eye-opening, and I definitely will integrate Claude Code into my workflow.</p>

<p>We purchased a new house after my last message, and I renovated it all by

is amazing, better than the previous renovations we&rsquo;ve handed to contractors.
I&rsquo;m very proud of it.</p>
<p>The new house comes with a swimming pool, so I have to learn how to maintain it.
It has been keeping me busy, but I&rsquo;m enjoying it especially when I see the kids

I felt it was so hard to type without auto-completion and I wanted to use an IDE or vscode.</p>

afraid that it would be hard to bear because older movies are very slow, but it
turned out to be the other way around. I was hooked on the story after the
first 15 minutes and couldn&rsquo;t help but finished the whole Episode IV in one
run. It&rsquo;s not like other recent films which I need to break one up to smaller
pieces to consume. This is very interesting! Onto the Episode V now!</p>
