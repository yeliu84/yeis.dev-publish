I need to mark this date because on that day I decided to seriously learn Emacs and switch to it as my primary text editor after my 12 years Vim journey.
Why? Because currently I am working on the new design of Gemsby and I have chosen to use TypeScript for the work. Unfortunately, TypeScript support in Vim is very weak at this moment, I need to spend a lot of time to fight my text editor which I would rather not to do. And the plugins&rsquo; development seems to be moving very slowly. This is critial becase TypeScript the language itself is moving very quickly, if the plugins can&rsquo;t keep up with the pace, developers will abandon the editor, then I will have no choice but switch to a different text editor&hellip; üò¢">

<p>Then, I have stumbled on this video a few days ago:</p>
<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
      <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen" loading="eager" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JWD1Fpdd4Pc?autoplay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" title="YouTube video"></iframe>
    </div>

<p>I actually have been thinking about trying Emacs again for quite some time now since my previous encounter with spacemacs, but I have never felt the urgency. This video is very interesting, and it is so convincing at the same time, which has led me to where I am right now &ndash; writing this blog post in Emacs!</p>
<p>I want to learn Emacs properly, so I am using the Homebrew&rsquo;s stock configuration and following the tutorial. I am like a 4-year old typing on a computer for the first time in this editor, the speed is very slow, and I am learning new commands and fighting with my Vim muscle memory at the same time üòñ.</p>
<p>It is very painful, but no pain no gain! This time I will keep learning and make Emacs my new text editor of choice.</p>
